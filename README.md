## ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning

Deep learning models included in this repository:

* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** â€“ applied to datasets like MNIST
* **Autoencoders** â€“ for unsupervised feature learning

## ðŸ”¹ Ensemble Techniques

Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy:

* **Bagging** â€“ reduces variance - Multiple models are trained independently on different subsets of the data, and their predictions are averaged (for regression) or voted on (for classification).- This helps reduce variance and prevents overfitting.
* **Boosting** â€“ reduces bias -  Models are trained sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors made by the previous ones. The final prediction is a weighted combination of all models, improving accuracy.
