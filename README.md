## Projects

### Used Car Price Prediction
This project aims to predict the selling price of a used car based on various features like model, year, mileage, and more. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

### Holiday Package Prediction
In this project, the goal is to predict customer interest in different holiday packages based on their preferences and demographic information. The project covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model development, and prediction.
